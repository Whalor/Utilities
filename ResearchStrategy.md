# Utilities
My main research strategy is first to take the idea I would like to implement and go to the 3 or 4 youtube channels that are very helpful
and reliable looking for a tutorial on what I am trying to implement if I can't find what I am looking for I will then try and break down
the idea into more managable parts trying to understand exactly what I will need to do to get what I want, and then I will try to find
tutorials on those basic parts accross youtube and if the problem has been broken down far enough I will go to the unity documentation and
research what it is I would like to use.
